# CalenderEventsProject
My choice to choose .NET framework as a platform to develop the Calender events as I was familiar with the 
concept and have worked on few projects already. I have also heard about the core concept for cross platform development and 
I am ready to learn if necessary

The choice for the fields for the Event class are EventDateTime(as both are available within single datatype) and Event Name. 
Since these were the important fields to be associated for a particular event, I went ahead with those.

For the REST API functions, considering the time I have chose only GET method and used it in two different methods
GetAllEvents - Returns all the events associated with the eventsCollections.
GetEventByName - Returns a particular event date and time based on the event name we provide as an input
I am also familiar with other REST API's like post,put and delete

           Executed my program as follows:
                    https://localhost:portno/api/Events
                   https://localhost:portno/api/Events/GetEventByName?EventName=TeamStatus

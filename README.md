# CalenderEventsProject
My choice to choose .NET framework as a platform to develop the Calender events as I was familiar with the 
concept and have worked on few projects already. I have heard about the core concept for cross platform development and 
I am ready to learn and implement it

The choice for the fields for the Event class are EventDateTime(as both are available within single datatype) and Event Name. 
These are the important fields to be associated with a particular event.

For the REST API functions, considering the time I have chose only GET method and used it in two different methods
GetAllEvents - Returns all the events associated with the eventsCollections
GetEventByName - Returns a particular event date and time based on the event name we provide
I am also familiar with other REST API's like post,put and delete

           Executed by program as follows:
                    https://localhost:portno/api/Events
                   https://localhost:portno/api/Events/GetEventByName?EventName=TeamStatus
